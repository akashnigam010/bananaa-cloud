                    <p>Food recommendation is our game and we are committed to it, by all our heart and soul.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Recommending food on Bananaa is open to all and everyone is invited to do so. However, before we add a restaurant on Bananaa, our team does a decent job of conducting a small research for it.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>We go over all the possible social media platforms (you name it), collect recommendations from people, conduct personal interviews and come up with a list of recommended food at a restaurant, before opening it up for you to add more to it.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>That way, we do our homework before enlisting a restaurant on Bananaa and make sure you never go wrong with your order.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p><span class="bna-color">And what happens after that ?</span></p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Well, after that its you and your friend's recommendations, that keep changing the shape of it. <br/> So go ahead, be a part of the community and recommend the food you love and help us in making this world a better place to eat.</p>
